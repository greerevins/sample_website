    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
      <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach <em>techincal sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning techincal sophistication, <em><strong>probably more</strong></em>. To join our movement, sign up for our official email list now.
